### Gaiwan

(a note on  nomenclature. i will often use these terms interchangeably because they all point to the thing doing the brewing: "gaiwan", "pot", "teapot", "brewing vessel". there are many more real names for all the various kinds but "pot" and "gaiwan" are what usually comes out of my mouth as the general term.)
#### size: 
75-150 mL
#### material: 
porcelain or glazed or glass

#### shape: 
best to try out your gaiwan with a dry run and just try to handle it to see if it feels snug and straight/ round, and comfortable to hold along the top edge where you will be gripping it trying not to burn your fingers. when you look at the bowl piece of the gaiwan, consider that the water cannot be above the line the lid makes where it rests. when you measure the volume of a gaiwan, you want to measure up to lid-level only, not full to the brim.
the amount of bowl above that line needs to be enough that you have somewhere cool to put your grip. the amount of fluting will affect the way it pours. make sure the lid is round and making a decent seal with the bowl.

a small size is very practical to test teas alone or with friends. 150 is pushing it if alone. smaller pots are the most versatile. because with hot water always on hand, you can do many steeps and mix them together in the fairness cup while serving.
to measure the volume, put it on a kitchen scale and tare. fill the gaiwan *to the fill line only* and the weight in grams (of the water) is equal to the volume in mL. 


the simple white gaiwan, which should be $10-20 max, is a core staple of our tea practice. but anything that is small and not porous (unglazed) clay is fine. yixing pots and other unglazed tea brewing vessels are great, but we must start at level 1, and that's level 2. and even people who are level 100 still need the little white gaiwan for certain situations. situations in which the brewer wishes to test an unknown tea, or otherwise make unbiased observations of a tea. because glazed materials are washed clean between uses, and during use the tea never penetrates the surface. it is a blank slate for your tea.
