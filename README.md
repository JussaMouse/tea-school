# Goals
- build a skillset for 
	- analyzing any tea to determine its best brewing parameters 
	- identifying bad tea and its causes
	- identifying the main characteristics of various famous teas/ styles
	- preparing any tea for company and serving
	- identifying high quality yixing teapots and their categories
	- knowing which prep methods are best for each tea/ situation/ pot type
- record time/ weight/ volume info in a journal
- store tea properly

# Glossary
(a note on  nomenclature. i will often use these terms interchangeably because they all point to the thing doing the brewing: "gaiwan", "pot", "teapot", "brewing vessel". there are many more real names for all the various kinds but "pot" and "gaiwan" are what usually comes out of my mouth as the general term.)
- gongfu tea: this is the name for the Chinese style of making tea with quick, repeated steepings in a small teapot. it comes from the same word as kungfu which means "diligent practice"
# Tools
### Gaiwan
![[gaiwan diagram]](https://i.imgur.com/qedQp5q.png)
gài wǎn / 蓋碗

#### size: 
75-150 mL (to fill-line)
#### material: 
porcelain or glazed clay or glass
#### shape: 
best to try out your gaiwan with a dry run and just try to handle it to see if it feels snug and straight/ round, and comfortable to hold along the top edge where you will be gripping it trying not to burn your fingers. when you look at the bowl piece of the gaiwan, consider that the water cannot be above the line the lid makes where it rests. when you measure the volume of a gaiwan, you want to measure up to lid-level only, not full to the brim.
the amount of bowl above that line needs to be enough that you have somewhere cool to put your grip. the amount of fluting will affect the way it pours. make sure the lid is round and making a decent seal with the bowl.

a small size is very practical to test teas alone or with friends. 150 is pushing it if alone. smaller pots are the most versatile. because with hot water always on hand, you can do many steeps and mix them together in the fairness cup while serving.
to measure the volume, put it on a kitchen scale and tare. fill the gaiwan *to the fill line only* and the weight in grams (of the water) is equal to the volume in mL. 


the simple white gaiwan, which should be $10-20 max, is a core staple of our tea practice. but anything that is small and not porous (unglazed) clay is fine. yixing pots and other unglazed tea brewing vessels are great, but we must start at level 1, and that's level 2. and even people who are level 100 still need the little white gaiwan for certain situations. situations in which the brewer wishes to test an unknown tea, or otherwise make unbiased observations of a tea. because glazed materials are washed clean between uses, and during use the tea never penetrates the surface. it is a blank slate for your tea.

#### technique
there is no right way to hold a gaiwan. as long as you can lift it, tilt it down and back up, and set it down without spilling the tea, you're doing it right. once you get the concept of sliding the lid just a bit to make a small opening, hold it tight, and pour the tea (and not the leaves) out of the slit. the natural way for most people to accomplish that is with a grip like this:

the saucer it comes with is optional. personally, i discard that part and just use the bowl/ lid parts sitting on top of some type of coaster.


### Fairness cup/ chahai/ gongdaobei

gōngdàobēi / 公道杯 

#### size: 
200-300 mL

#### material: 
porcelain or glazed clay or glass

it is the second tool in our standard gongfu tea kit. it is a necessary intermediary between the gaiwan and the teacups. one reason is that when the time comes to end the steep, you must dump the tea out as quickly as possible. the other reason, and origin of the name Fairness cup, is that the last drop to leave the pot at the end of a pour is the best part, and if you were decanting from the teapot directly into the teacups, you would, unfairly, have to choose which cup to give it to. but with the fairness cup it mixes with the other tea before being served.



i recommend a simple glass one. there are many nice shapes that you can browse on taobao. but handling in person before buying is best, because you can ask to test it with water and check the quality of the spout (pour). it's good general advice to say in-person buying is better, but for gaiwan/ teapot/ fairness cup it's actually really important compared to, say, teacups/ coasters/ tea trays.

for clay ones i would recommend no unglazed, otherwise go crazy. some people like them to be white on the inside for tea observation. that's generally why white porcelain teacups are popular for tea tasting kits (essentially what we're constructing), too.
